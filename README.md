# Med-Port

## Inspiration
The inspiration came to me During the Covid-19 Period where people got stuck away from their families in different parts of the world. Many people have gone to visit there loved ones for some time which they didn't knew would become a nightmare. People weren’t Ready for such a disaster. The people who suffered the most were the middle class people. Many People got stuck in unknown places where they knew nothing about the places. Elderly and Medical Patients could not go out to seek medical attention.
Many People May have forgot their Medical reports or their medicines, etc. due to which they faced many problems. Parents got separated from their Childs. people have to go through all the test which could have been avoided if they had their reports with them. Senior Citizens couldn't go out to take appointments from the hospital, all this could have been avoided if there was an facility. The Reason is that I personally Got to know about this problem with my parents when they weren’t able to go to hospitals for their regular medical check-ups due to the Lockdown in the country. 

## What it does
So This is Software is a all in one solution for all the healthcare facilities. The user will create a account and get a Unique Health ID just like Aadhar card but for Medical Data. Every user will get a unique Health ID with which they can store there Medical data on the platform. The user can find Medical Services offered by different Hospitals and Healthcare Centers and at what cost. The Hospitals will be able to upload patients Reports on the Software so that time will be reduced for getting the reports. Also it will be hassle free to carry physical copy of reports everywhere you go. Just give the UHID and the Hospitals will be able to get your report from there end of the software. No worry to loose reports. With the help of this Children's who live in abroad and the parents live alone in other country can book services for their parents. from anywhere around the world. everything will be stored on the UHID for the convenience. The Main Objective of the Project is that this website will be a hub for all the Medical
Facilities Such as Taking Appointments in Hospitals, Checking Nearby Pharmacy, Blood
Banks, Healthcare centers etc. the user will need to register with their personal
information. After registration a Unique user ID will be given to every user. Users can
update their Health condition, allergies, etc. on their user profile. This will be just like a
Aadhar card but for Health. This can be Issued as a legal document just like a Aadhaar
card. Everything will be stored digitally. The Scope of the project is good in future as the medical records will be stored in digital format so there is no fear of losing or damaging the Medical Reports. Also every thing will be available just by the User ID.

## How we built it
We Built it using HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, MongoDB, EJS, PHP, SCSS etc.
We will Build the Flutter App With The @ company Platform for more convenience and which can be accessed from the Mobile Phones. 
Authorization with Sawo Labs API for User Security and the Privacy
The Chat will be Powered with the Symbol.ai Platform where the users can directly contact available doctors and can ask their query.
Linode cloud for Data Storage and compute power.
Go Daddy for Domain Registration.
Twilio to incorporate mobile messaging, phone calls and a ton of other awesome communication features from the patients to the doctors, to be in touch with the doctors ands update them about their condition.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges like Storing User data Securely , Creating Unique ID's For everyone, and many more. Making the interface for Hospitals and the Users different. We ran into the problem of storing the users data efficiently.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are Proud that we have successfully Created a Prototype, the Website is almost finished,  We created a roadmap of what need to be done in the future.

## What we learned
We have Learned about how to tackle the Problems, Brainstorm and discuss them, and use Hit and Trial method as much as possible, because Failures ae a step closer to success.

## What's next for Med-Port
In Future We are Planning to add More Features like Emergency Contact Services, etc. We are also planning to launch an Mobile application for the Software, for more use of convenience. We are also planning to add more features like ordering medicine through the software and ordering tests, etc. So this project will help the people in many ways, and can change the future in the field
of Healthcare Sciences.


## Motive In Short Term:
This will be the Aadhar for Health, where everyone will get Unique Health ID(UHID) and this can be verified as a Legal Document.
All of the USers Medical data can be Uploaded to the user's profile by the Hospitals or healthcare centre like CT Scans, MRI's, etc  through the Software by entering the UHID.
Reports can be Accessed From anywhere and anytime.
No need to carry Physical Reports Everywhere You Go.
User's Medications, their Health Conditions, their Previous Check-ups Reports, everything can be Seen through the software.
Doctors can access the Reports of a Particular Patient through Th UHID on their Computers.
Patients can take appointments, book Services, Book Vaccinations, order medicines and Order Blook Test etc. Through the software from the comfort if their home.
The task of carrying physical reports will be ended if this is implemented.
